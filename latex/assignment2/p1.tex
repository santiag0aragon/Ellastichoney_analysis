Internet Service Providers are the problem owners of the security issue as measured in our first assignment. It is of primary interest to them to avoid having unwanted traffic in their network due to botnets. This is undesirable as it would exhaust their resources and cost them money.

Cloud  providers enable sharing of computing resources like storage, services, servers, networks, and application. They are provided with minimum management efforts and very quickly. With this background, attackers can use their cloud bots for distributed password-cracking, click fraud, or denial of service attacks that flood target websites with junk traffic. Because the cloud services offer far more networking bandwidth than the average home computer possesses, their botnet can funnel huge attack traffic at any given target which is undesirable for cloud providers.
