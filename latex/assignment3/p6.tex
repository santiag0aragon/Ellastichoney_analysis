In figure 4 and 5, we show the no of attacks on hourly basis and no of attacks during day [6 A.M -10 P.M] and night [10 P.M -6 A.M], respectively. From figure 5, we can see significant difference in number of attacks during day and night. We can see 37.5\% of the attacks happening during night and 62.5\% of the attacks happening during day. This might be due to the fact that infected bots are mostly active (on, working) during day and not active (off, not working) during night. We believe that Botnet infection attempts are higher during the day as a result of this.
