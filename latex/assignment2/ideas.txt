1 Who is the problem owner of the security issue as measured in your first assignment?
Pallavi:
LEA and businesses(I would not like to include ISPs because they lack incentives to fight bots as 
they may have to invest without reaping any exclusive benefits, 
it is often businesses who has to take steps to fight them. I know that we have mentioned onlt ISPs and LEA)
2 What relevant differences in security performance does your metric reveal?
Pallavi:
a)We can assign infection rate to sub networks(The degree to which the different parts of network has been infected)
b)We can point to the regional locations according to cities and can help measure the scale of attacks coming from a particular geographical location
c)we can mitigate the risk of potential impacts to critical infrastructure based on the geographical source(the attack is coming from )
d)To measure the effectiveness of mitigating controls.
3 What risk strategies can the problem owner follow to reduce the security issue as measured in your first assignment?
a)
4 What other actors can influence the security issue as measured in your first assignment?

5 Identify the risk strategies that the actors can adopt to tackle the problem
are there actors with different strategies? why?
have the strategies changed significantly over time in a way that reduces or increases risks?

6 Pick one of the risk strategies identified previously and calculate the Return on Security Investment (ROSI) for that particular strategy. I.e.,
7 Estimate the costs involved in following that strategy
8 Estimate the benefits of following that strategy (assume a particular loss distribution)
