% What relevant differences in security performance does your metric reveal
%ToDo : cite owr first article
In this section we analize the output of the metrics proposed in~\cite{owr_article}. Based on this output we compare the performance of the distinct network owners. We detail how the security performance can me compared using applying the metrics to a subset of the the problem owners i.e. ISPs in Beijing.
% consider costumer, address space and services

\subsection{BN propagation}
% Overal growth (per network ?)
% Total cost ?
\subsection{Network infection radio}
% % Infection ratio between net owners
\subsection{BN geographical and digital location}
