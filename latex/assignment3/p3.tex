ISPs:

When ISPs cleans up botnet malware from the network, users’ demand for network access and thus ISP’s profits can increase because of the elimination of negative factors. However, ISPs have limited incentives to invest in botnet mitigation. At the same time, if the clean-up cost per user largely raises the access fee, the demand and ISP’s profits can also decrease. 

The revenue of ISPs are not (directly) affected by the botnets and ISPs would probably welcome some external funding in the efforts to fight botnets. In this direction, a government-sponsored program would be of great help to ISPs[example: Australia and Germany]. In the case governments are unwilling to fund these initiatives, ISPs need to find a way to make them, at the very least, cost neutral if not cost positive. 

Considering the increasing trend of botnet ad-fraud attacks and the consequently increasing loss of ad revenue for ad networks, Ad Networks have economic incentives to fight botnets. However, Ad Networks are not in the best position to thwart botnets themselves and thus ANs might be willing to subsidize the ISPs to achieve that goal. Such cooperation would help ISPs deploy detection and remediation mechanisms and would of help in fighting botnets. 

if liability for violations of cyber security is imposed on ISP, it may overreact. Because detecting and cleaning up botnet malware in users’ computers are costly, ISP may rather choose to disconnect users whose computers are vulnerable to malware infection.

Cloud Service Providers:

The customers pay for the cloud services, there is(legal) objections to any attack(botnet) on their data and the price of Cloud services would continue to drop if bot activities on the Cloud affect users. Cloud service providers are legally  bound to protect legitimate users of Cloud services from botnet infection. Cloud Service Providers have economic incentives to fight botnets.

End Users:

Home users are well aware of the consequences of botnet infection due to their valuable data, money and productivity at stake, and some of them join arms in fighting botnets. It might also be that unlike ISP, these home users can directly enjoy the incentives of having protected machines. On the other hand, it is about security versus availability, speed, or usability in their business and finally, the monetary benefits of security measures not being very explicit might not motivate all the users to do the same.

Mid and small sized businesses relying on online services suffer as they lack necessary resources to offer safe financial transactions for their customers and their bigger concern would be about their turnover and staying competitive, rather than investing on botnet mitigation.
