Our main focus for the analytics will include identifying clear statistics on events from whom, from where and what attacks recorded in the JSON logs available. The following metric definitions will help us critically analyze the nature and characteristics of attacker behavior, the means of predicting the attack, the severity of the incident and resources needed to mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.    
\indent
\paragraph{Attacker Behavior:}
The inputs for this metric will include geographical locations / regions such as continent, country and city name. The different methods and types of various user agents used to exploit the vulnerability paying particular attentions to the application names. The majority of source IPs sending data traffic. The form and payload strings matching the actual exploit. The number of recurring attacks from particular IPs. The most important of all is the breakdown of the individual payload and its various instruction sets. Thus by analyzing these trends and rankings of different key data fields, one can predict the methodology and characteristic of the attackers behavior.

\paragraph{Attack Prediction / Probability:}
The required data for this metric will include specific port numbers that are being used including the majority of source IPs sending data traffic via URLs with payloads attached. The method and nature of data transfer via URLs for direct path to vulnerabilities that are exploitable. The number of port scan attempts without including payloads and recurring attacks from particular IPs. These datasets will help to derive patterns for attack prediction and probability of successfully exploiting the vulnerability. 
\indent
\paragraph{Scale of Incident:}
The inputs for this metric will include the payload strings matching the actual exploit. The amount of valid and invalid vulnerabilities, malicious IPs and the percentage of false positives. The sum of individual attacks within a specific time interval. This metric will therefore help to determine the nature and level of attack strength and effort put in to gain access to critical infrastructure.
