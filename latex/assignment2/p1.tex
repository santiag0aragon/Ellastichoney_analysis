Internet Service Providers are the problem owners of the security issue as measured in our first assignment. It is of primary interest to them to avoid having unwanted traffic in their network due to botnets. This is undesirable as it would exhaust their resources and cost them money.
% I really don't know how to connect cloud providers wit ISP, I just used your sentence.
If the owner includes network owner,we have Cloud providers too who enable sharing of computing resources like storage, services, servers, networks, and application. With this background, attackers can use their cloud bots for distributed password-cracking, click fraud, or denial of service attacks that flood target websites with junk traffic. Because the cloud services offer far more networking bandwidth than the average home computer possesses, botnet can funnel huge attack traffic at any given target which is undesirable for cloud providers.
