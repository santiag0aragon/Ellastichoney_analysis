Historically, responses to propagation of botnet-infections within the Internet ecosystem have relied heavily on ISPs, but recently remediation efforts have evolved to include other stake holders / actors to tackle our security issue. These actors have direct involvement with end-user machines to help mitigate the impact of the security issue and have increasingly recognize the long-term impact of malware upon their customers and online services. These actors include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Vendors of Operating Systems}
\item \textit{Software Solution Providers.}
\item \textit{Domain Registrars.}
\item \textit{Vendors of Security Services.}
\item \textit{Cloud & Hosting Service Providers.}
\item \textit{End-Users.}End-users comprise of home / individuals users and small to medium businesses employees. They create negative externalities caused by risky online behavior and not deploying preventive controls such as antivirus and security software.
\end{itemize}
