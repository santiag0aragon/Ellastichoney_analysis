1 Who is the problem owner of the security issue as measured in your first assignment?

2 What relevant differences in security performance does your metric reveal?

3 What risk strategies can the problem owner follow to reduce the security issue as measured in your first assignment?

4 What other actors can influence the security issue as measured in your first assignment?

5 Identify the risk strategies that the actors can adopt to tackle the problem
are there actors with different strategies? why?
have the strategies changed significantly over time in a way that reduces or increases risks?

6 Pick one of the risk strategies identified previously and calculate the Return on Security Investment (ROSI) for that particular strategy. I.e.,
7 Estimate the costs involved in following that strategy
8 Estimate the benefits of following that strategy (assume a particular loss distribution)
