Cloud Providers 
Cloud  providers enable sharing of computing resources like storage, services, servers, networks, and application. They are provided with minimum management efforts and very quickly. With this background, attackers can use their cloud bots for distributed password-cracking, click fraud, or denial of service attacks that flood target websites with junk traffic. Because the cloud services offer far more networking bandwidth than the average home computer possesses, their botnet can funnel huge attack traffic at any given target which is undesirable for cloud providers.
